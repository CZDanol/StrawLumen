In VS2015 console, call configure.bat in Qt/SRC folder

This is how it works: from your Qt SDK installation, with QtCreator open D:\Qt\4.5.1\src\plugins\sqldrivers\sqlite\sqlite.pro (this is the sqlite sql driver)

And add this, after the first DEFINES += :

DEFINES += SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS

Eventually, change the source paths to a most recent version of SQLite sources (the ‘amalgamon’ version)

Build and voila, now you are able do this in your projects:

if (!query.exec("Select Path, Snippet(FTS3Component, '**','**','') as Snippet "
"from FTS3Component WHERE "
"Content MATCH 'file_dump'"))

and

if (!query.exec("CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE FTS3Component"
" USING FTS3(Path TEXT, Content TEXT,"
" tokenize simple 'dummy' ' .;:!,[]')"))

That’s it, Happy Indexing
